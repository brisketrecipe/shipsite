        Hello, my name is Filip, I am from the USA, and I am creating this blog because I want to connect
        with others, get my thoughts out, and maybe theres a chance something I put out actually helps 
        somebody like the content that other people put out helps me.

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        What I want to really talk about in this post is conviction. Conviction and Action. Defining where
        your convictions lie, your beliefs will affect every action that is taken thereafter. Without conviction,
        you are at the whim of your circumstances, your environment, and what you consume. Without action, you do not
        move anywhere. Before I go into what I feel I have the most conviction on, I am going to review an outline
        framework for how work is effectively done. I am a thinker and like to break things down to fundamentals, 
        consistencies that are very simple, as simple as possible.

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        So what does this mean, what am I saying. Conviction x Energy. Energy is Skill x Work. If you are a level 1
        skill but a level 10 work, your output is 10. If you are a level 10 skill but a level 1 work, you get the same
        output. If you are an 8 on both your output is 6x linearly, which I think its safe to say this output is
        exponential.

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        I will probably expand on these ideas, and i probably had more to write when I was inspired, but I had to figure
        out how to get this blog up and now I just want to post it and go get something to eat.

        <br></br>

        My convictions, in order:
        <br></br>
        Tier 1 Convictions
        <br></br>
        1. Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior
        <br></br>

        2. Bitcoin is the best store of value over time periods
        <br></br>

        3. The Value of Individual Creativity is increasing
        <br></br>
        Tier 2 Convictions
        <br></br>
        4. AI is growing exponentially and AGI is coming    
        <br></br>
        Tier 3 Convictions
        <br></br>
        5. The metaverse and real world will be co-integrated. This is tier 3 because what it looks like is the
        blurriest for me. But optimistic.

        <br></br>
        <br></br>


        If you align with any of these convictions, please stay up to date with future posts! Thanks!
